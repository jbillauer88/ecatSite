  </p><p>The projectECAT WIKI is a compilation of art-science references, resources and background on Project ECAT - "ECAT- an EcoAcoustic Toolkit for research and the advancement of scientific and creative literacy in ecology ". The 2-year research project is a collaboration between the University of Denver, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.du.edu/ahss/edp">EDP</a> - Emergent Digital Practices Program and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ccrma.stanford.edu">CCRMA</a>- the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics at Stanford University. Principal co-investigators are  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.timothyweaver.org">Timothy Weaver</a> from EDP and  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.jonathanberger.net">Dr. Jonathan Berger</a> of CCRMA. Project ECAT is supported by the National Academies (of Science, Engineering and Medicine) Keck Futures Initiative - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.keckfutures.org">NAKFI</a> . This ECATwiki will serve as a collaborative resource for the advancement of EcoAcoustic research, the exploration of this project and future creative and scientific investigations.
  </p><p><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
  </p><p>Ecoacoustics has deepened our understanding of ecological issues and established profound visceral connections to ecological data. The EcoAcousticToolkit (ECAT) will expand the scope of <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Ecoacoustic_research" title="Ecoacoustic research">ecoacoustic research</a> providing <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Sonic_software" title="Sonic software">sonic software</a> and <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Hardware_tools" title="Hardware tools">hardware tools</a> integrating <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonification">sonification</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auralization">auralization</a> of endangered environments to  enhance literacy and awareness of fragile and endangered acoustic ecologies.
  </p><p>Beyond representing current ecological situations, we extend the perception of acoustic space and time. Imagine, for example, soundscapes of extinct species or ecosystems before they were impacted by humans. Imagine acoustic ecologies that project into the future. Might we speed up time and listen to evolution? Can we hear the interactions and impact of atmospheric, geological, seismic and anthropogenic changes? How might we capture and interpret the unique listening and experiential qualities of acoustic ecologies for the preservation of natural spaces for future generations?
  </p><p>The EcoAcousticToolkit (ECAT) will provide new means to model acoustic environments, and novel <a href="/wiki/index.php?title=Methods" title="Methods">methods</a> to experience ecological data. From its research potential, ECAT will raise public environmental consciousness by providing an integrated toolset for exploration of, and interaction with data from endangered and at-risk ecosystems. The tools will scale from the biomolecular to the ecospheric with methods that provide a contextual system of access, learning, documentation and distribution for scientists, artists and citizen scientists.

  <b>PROJECT OBJECTIVES</b>
  </p><p>1) Expand the concepts and technology of sonification and sonic interpretation software/methods for exploring new sensoria for the transcoding of ecoinformation from data to sound output.
  </p><p>2) Develop ecoacoustic software, hardware and methods for recording, spatial characterization/auralization and analysis; data interpretation, interaction and creative composition.
  </p><p>3) Interpret data connections to complex ecological simulation software engines and data feeds as available inputs for additive data modifications of sound.
  </p><p>4) Conduct and archive field sonic profiles from a diversity of identified endangered ecoacoustic spaces to begin an auralization database/directory for the preservation of global acoustic ecologies. Locations:  Yr. 1: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_sempervirens">Coastal Redwoods</a>, California (2 sites); <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruvian_Amazon">Amazonian Peru</a> (2 sites). Yr. 2:  <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Summer_Mountains">Never Summer Range</a>, Colorado (1 site); Coastal Redwoods, California (2 sites)
  </p><p>5) Design and prototype specialized open-source hardware for microphone design, physical surfaces and 3D form for interactivity with ecoacoustic data as novel approaches to sound capture and data instrumentation.
  </p><p>6) Author ECAT tutorials, documentation and streamlined applications inclusive to engaged citizen scientists for future expanded ecoacoustic field sampling surveys, and
  </p><p>7) Demonstrate the ‘reduction to practice’ of these toolkits for content/compositions and listening space simulation as exemplary exploratory artistic works and experimental scientific applications for ecosystem preservation. Conduct ECAT Release Symposium for toolkit Introduction, application workshops, composition, performance and scientific application dialogue/showcase.
